# Genesis Offroad Jeep JL Battery Cover

When doing some electrical work on my Jeep Wrangler JLU, I decided to install the [Genesis Offroad Stock Battery Replacement Kit](https://www.genesisoffroad.com/products/2018-jeep-jl-jt-stock-battery-replacement-kit_p_295).  While the kit is well thought out, it leaves several positive battery terminals exposed to accidental short-circuit.  This project creates a cover for those terminals.
